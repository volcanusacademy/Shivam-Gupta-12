/* The project basically gives the user the option to ask if he is renting a car [Y or N]:

if Y is inputed, then it ask about "C” for Compact or “F” for Full-size,

if the user selects compact the project displays that the user has selected compact and

if the code displays fullsize the project displays that the user has selected fullsize.

Then it asks the user if they have a coupon or not by “Y” or “N” if the users answer Y for the coupon the price is 7% off on 456.56 for compact car.

If the user answers N the price is a normal 456.56. The fullsize normal price is 460.50 and the price with a coupon is 7% off on 460.50.*/
