        In one of my favourite short ghost stories, a man thinks that he loses his phone and someone is playing atrick on him.
        Turns out, there is someone playing with him, but it’s a ghoul rather than a person. Submitted via Reddit by Buzzfeed: 
        “Last night a friend rushed me out of the house to catch the opening act at a local bar’s music night.
        After a few drinks I realized my phone wasn’t in my pocket. I checked the table we were sitting at, the bar, the bathrooms,
        and after no luck I used my friend’s phone to call mine. After two rings someone answered, gave out a low raspy giggle, and hung up.
        They didn’t answer again. I eventually gave it up as a lost cause and headed home. I found my phone laying on my nightstand, right where I left it.”
